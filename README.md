# LMCS-261: Introduction to Computer Programming

Welcome, Programmers!!!

## Description
In this course, students learn the fundamentals of computer programing that serve as a foundation for developing software applications and further exploration of programming languages. Instead of focusing on a single language or platform, this course prepares students to understand computer code in general and to understand the role computers can play in solving real-world and creative problems. By recognizing the concepts that are universal in computer programming, students are better prepared to understand any codes they come across, providing them with advanced problem-solving skills that are important when adapting to different languages based on specific situations. The logical thinking and technical skills students learn in this course can be used to develop a wide range of practical applications on the web, and in game, software, and product development. Because Berklee is an Apple institution, software applications are used with MacOS.
This is an introductory survey course of Python, JavaScript, HTML, and SQL.

## Class Resources

**[Think Python, Second Edition](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html)**
Allen B. Downey, 2015

**[Eloquent JavaScript, Third Edition](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)**
Marijn Haverbeke, 2018

### Everyday Tools

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

* [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

* [Git + GitHub.com + GitHubDesktop](https://github.blog/2019-10-02-get-started-easier-with-github-desktop-2-2/)

* This is an [Equitable](https://www.berklee.edu/equity-policy-and-process/equity-policy) learning environment. Our coding code of conduct means: problem-solve constructively with respectful language; be patient with yourselves and others (especially when mistakes are made); never posture/pose/attitudinize; always speak up and admit when you do not understand something - it is the smartest thing you can do.

Description|Grade
---|---:|
Attendance and Participation| 30%
Homework (9 assignments)| 30%
Midterm - March 16| 10%
Final Project - May 11| 30%
**Total**|**100%**

## Submissions and documentation

### Guidelines for submissions
- Every assignment must be submitted via both GitHub and the OL.
- Late submissions will not be accepted, but I will drop the lowest homework grade.
- Most assignments you submit must have two parts:
  - the code/program itself (eg. a .py file)
  - documentation of the code/program (always a .md file)

### Steps to submit via GitHub+theOL
  1. Make a folder in your GitHub private repository named after the assignment (i.e. {yourusername}/itp/ford, {yourusername}/itp/scratch, etc.)
  2. Commit all parts of your assignment (code+documentation) into the assignment repository folder
  3. Submit the link for the assignment repository folder in the OL

### Documentation outline
  - The documentation (again, always in Markdown as a .md file) must have the following:
    - what you did
    - how you did it
    - the problems you faced (ABDYD: always be documenting your debugging!)
    - how you overcame them
    - *what code you used from others/elsewhere*
      - where to find that code (specific links!)
    - If your problem set does not run correctly document all your debugging. I will take points off for code that does not run correctly, but will still give partial credit if it is well-documented.
    - For the purposes of this class, your documentation also helps you prepare to talk about your code in class with your colleagues.

- Late assignments are not acccepted.
- You will be held to the Berklee Policy on Honesty in Academic Work (see Student Handbook).
- You must attend class with the computer you're using for class projects (no phones, no tablets, no borrowed laptops).
- Keep your laptops closed and other electronic devices out of hand during lectures and discussions unless you're taking notes.
- Excused absences may be granted in advance of class or with a doctors note specifying the day of the absence or a note from your advisor.
- Whether an absence is excused or not is at my discretion and will not be excused for gigs, studio time, or visiting artist events.
- More than 2 excused absences require a note from your advisor. Without such a note, they’ll be unexcused.
- If you are more than 5 minutes late for class or leave more than 5 minutes early, you'll automatically receive a partial attendance grade for the week.
- If you miss more than 40 minutes of class, you'll be marked absent.
- If you are disruptive in the class (talking, sleeping, using your laptop or phone beyond classwork) you'll receive one written warning and then receive a partial attendance grade if/when the disruptive behavior continues.
- When you are absent you are responsible for the materials of the class you missed. *I will not catch you up over email,* but you may come ask me questions during my office hour after you have reviewed the materials.
- Attendance the week of Finals is mandatory (see Student Handbook).
- I don't answer emails that can be answered with a one-step Google search (i.e. “How do I change the timezone on my Google Calendar?”).
- I don't answer emails when the answer can be found in the syllabus (here).
- I don't answer emails evenings or weekends.
- When you email me, you must let me know what class/section you're in.
- If you have a question about a grade, you must come ask it *in person* at my office hour.
- The best way to communicate with me outside of class is *always* to make an appointment with me in my office hour.
