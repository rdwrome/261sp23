# Objects

## Object-oriented programming
- Some languages can do it, some languages must do it, e.g. javaScript *can* do it, Python *must* do it
- Principles of OOP
    - Encapsulation
  		- object: independent part of the program that manages itself (own rules and ways of doing things)
      - objects are made up of values + variables
      - objects are what Python manipulates
      - objects are reusable
      - a specific realization of an object is a
  	- Inheritance
      - objects get their functions from classes
      - class: template, blueprint for creating objects
  		- superclass is parent, class is child
  		- class inherits attributes of parent (through abstraction) but modifies, evolves
      - classes are reusable
  	- Polymorphism
  		- change the way something works by overriding and overloading
      - change type, have multiple types work together
  		- overriding: walk to moon walk
  		- overloading: walk to run

## Abstraction Redux
	- Abstraction: to deal with complex systems, we can ignore inessential details of other parts of the program as long as we understand what they do
	- In Python, modules and packages make the general language more specific with this use of abstraction

## Python Modules and Packages
	- Modules: simple .py file that abstracts out specific information (functions, variables, other things)
	- Packages (or libraries) are a collection of modules
	 - out-of-date dependencies can be the root of all your evils

## FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL:

***Outline for Final Project Proposal***
  1. Description of the deliverable
  2. What problem does the project solve?
  3. What resources will you use? (specific links to others' code)
  4. What are the use cases? (who is your 'audience'?)
  5. Timeline
  6. How do you think you should be assessed?
