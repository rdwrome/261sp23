# Assignment - Haiku

1. Find a [Haiku](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/haiku-or-hokku) or other very short poem, refrain. Record an .aiff audio file of your computer "saying" the poem with the CLI
	- Hints:
		- You'll need to use pwd, ls, and cd to make sure you create the .aiff file in a place you can easily find
		- You may use a -v tag
		- You'll need to use -o
		- See aiff recording demo .png in this folder for even more hints

3. SUBMIT (as a link in the OL to an assignment folder in *your* GitHub repository):
		- Your .aiff file
		- A documentation file (in Markdown as an .md file!) of the .aiff file as outlined in the syllabus.
