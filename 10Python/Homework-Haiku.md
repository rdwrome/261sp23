		- You'll need to use pwd, ls, and cd to make sure you create the .aiff file in a place you can easily find
		- You'll need to use -v
		- You'll need to use -o
		- See aiff recording demo .png in this folder for even more hints

3. SUBMIT (as a link in the OL to an assignment folder in *your* GitHub repository):
		- Your .aiff file
		- A documentation file (in Markdown as an .md file!) that includes:
		a) one thing you knew and one thing you did not know for each chapter of the reading and
		b) documentation of the .aiff file as outlined in the syllabus.
