## Assignment-Ford

- Set up a GitHub.com account with a simple username you can use professionally
- Follow [me](https://github.com/rdwrome)
- Accept my invitation to join the class private repository
- Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- Read over the syllabus. Bring any questions you have to the next class.

- In GitHub Desktop, go to File > Clone Repository and clone the class private repository
- Setup GitHub/save the local file path (where the files are on your computer) somewhere you can easily find the files (i.e. Documents, Desktop NOT iCloud!)
- Go to File > New repository
- Create a new repository called "itp"
- Check the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README" and check again that your local file path goes somewhere you can easily find; let the repository stay public (for now)
- Your new repository will appear in the far left bar of the GitHub Desktop window.
- Click on the repository and then select "Publish this repository to GitHub"
- When that has gone through go to Repository > Open in VSC
- The README.md file of the repository you created for this class will open in VSC

- Read the assigned section of [this great article](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) and make a simple [MarkDown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) outline of it in the README.md of your "itp" repository you've just created and opened in VSC
- Save the file in VSC
- Open GitHubDesktop. With your "itp" repository selected in the upper left-hand corner, in the lower left-hand corner of the screen you'll see your user icon next to a textbar that says "Update README.md" in grey. Write "update" in that textbar.
- Press the blue "Commit to main" button below it
- A blue button towards the center of the screen that says "Push origin" should pop up. Press it. That is you saving your local harddrive version of the "itp" README.md to GitHub.com
- Go to Repository > View on GitHub
- Copy this GitHub.com link and paste it into the OL. It should read something like:
https://github.com/{YOURUSERNAME}/itp/blob/main/README.md

This week you're submitting this single link to the OL Assignment-Ford drop box and you're done! Congratulations!
