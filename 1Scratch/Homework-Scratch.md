## Read Chapters 1 & 2 in "Think Python"

## Assignment-Scratch

- Implement a Scratch project with the following requirements:
	- Use at least two sprites (please, for my sake, no cats).
	- Have at least three scripts or threads total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
	- Must use at least one condition or one loop.
	- Must use at least one variable.
	- Must use at least one sound.

- Some Tips:
	- Try to think of an idea on your own, and then set out to implement it.
	- Write a code a bit by bit. Take baby steps.
	- Test your project often before adding and writing more to it.
	- Save your project often!

- Project must be saved as a .sb3 file in a folder for this week in *your* GitHub class repo and linked to the OL!
- Folder must also contain a .md documentation file (as outlined in the syllabus/main README here)
