## Assignment-Scratch

1. Read Chapters 1 & 2 in "Think Python"

2. Implement a Scratch project with the following requirements:
	- Use at least two sprites (please, for my sake, no cats).
	- Have at least three scripts or threads total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
	- Must use at least one condition or one loop.
	- Must use at least one variable.
	- Must use at least one sound.

3. SUBMIT (as a link in the OL to an assignment folder in *your* GitHub repository):
	- Your Scratch Project as an .sb3 file
	- A documentation file (in Markdown as an .md file!) that includes:
	a) one thing you knew and one thing you did not know for each chapter of the reading and
	b) documentation of the .sb3 file as outlined in the syllabus.
