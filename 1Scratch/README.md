# Scratch

## Reading Group Reports

## Basics principles
- Functions: actions/verbs
- Variables: grasp and store values
- Boolean: true or false conditions
- Loops: cycles, reiterations
- Syntax: expectations information organization
- Threads: multi-tasking

## Pseudocode
- Break down the way to solve to problem into the smallest tasks possible, but in the language you speak to yourself
- Think like a computer, be literal! Algorithmic thinking!

## Simon Says Pseudocode
<br>Imagine we are each a machine. Give us precise instructions for a simple dance using one function, one condition, and one loop.</br>

## Code Reuse
- Stand on the shoulders of giants
- Be a good collaborator

## Compiled vs Interpreted Computer Languages
- Compiled: human readable > machine readable
- Interpreted: human readable > interpreter > machine readable

## Compiled languages: Source, Object, Compiler, Executable
- Source: what we write (human readable)
- Compiler: translates from source to object
- Object: binary (machine readable)
- Executable: actually runs program

## Compiled languages
- Fortran
- C
- C++
- Rust

## Interpreted languages
- Python
- Ruby
- JavaScript

## Memory

**[How Computer Memory Works Ted-Ed by Kanawat Senanan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3q5zWCw8J4)**

**RAM**

	- Structure
		- Address Line: where data moves in 1 bit pulses of electricity
		- Data Line: where data is is stored (8 bits in every Byte)
		- Transistor (type of semi-conductor): switches signals
		- Capacitor: stores electricity

**Data Types**

	- certain kinds of data take up certain amounts of memory
	- integer is also 4 bytes or 32 bits in Python, float is 8 bytes or 64 bits


**Memory Layout**

	- Stack
		- Where variables and functions hang out waiting to be used (environment)
	- Heap
		- Where to find free memory for environment
	- Low address
	- High address

**Memory Address**

	- With characters/strings

## [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
- Sprites: characters
- Costume: image of character
- Threads: how to multi-task
- How to save as an .sb3 file
