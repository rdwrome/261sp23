## Reading Group Reports

## Abstraction
- Lower-level implementation details are hidden below higher-level ideas

## Algorithms and Algorithmic Efficiency
- Algorithms are the programmatic problem-solving instructions

- The better the instructions, the quicker the result

## Basics principles
- Functions: actions/verbs
- Variables: grasp and store values
- Conditions: send you down different paths
- Boolean: true or false conditions
- Loops: cycles
- Syntax: organization of information
- Threads: multi-task

## Pseudocode
- Break down the way to solve to problem into the smallest tasks possible
- Think like a computer, be literal! Algorithmic thinking!

## Simon Says Pseudocode
<br>Imagine we are each a machine. Give us precise instructions for a movement or series of movements using one function, one condition, and one loop.</br> (maybe harvard video after all, Rachel)

## How Git Works

Git is a backup and collaboration tool for individuals and groups working together on software and hardware projects. GitHub is a particular platform on which a user can make use of Git features.

Git does this by recording the changes you've made to a file rather than the file itself. This is why a focus is put on the lines added and removed from a project during any commit. This system makes two things easier: First, a user can revert to any previous commit. Say your software worked well yesterday, but now it's broken. If you're simply editing a file on your computer, you have no way of looking through your past actions. Second, GitHub doesn't need to store large amounts of data to store simple changes, as it only records the differences between files as opposed to the files themselves.

### Making a New Repository

In Github Desktop, a new repository (repo) can be created by clicking "Current Repository" on the top left, and then "add", and then "create new repository".

A repo can also be downloaded from GitHub.com by clicking "Current Repository on the top left, and then "add", and then "clone repository". This will allow you to input the URL of the GitHub.com repo you'd like to clone and the destination you'd like to clone it to.

Repositories are like folders but! they must have a file in them to be updated with git. Empty folders made on your computer cannot be synced up to GitHub.com.

### Logging Changes

See the previous commits of a project in GitHub Desktop in the "History" pane of GitHub Desktop.

### Updating to GitHub.com: Staging, Committing, Pushing

- Stage all (staging is where you customize what changes go into the commit)
- Add commit message (explains what your change is)
- Push to remote

### Updating from GitHub.com

- Fetch: see what is changed
- Merge: changes your local (hardrive) copy to match the remote/cloud (GitHub.com)
- Pull: Fetch + Merge

### Other Resources

There are many great online guides to Git, from a very simple one [here](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) to a slightly more detailed one [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-git-and-how-to-use-it-c341b049ae61). There is also a great [codecademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) on Git.
